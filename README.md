# _Glass_, updated

This is a copy of the interactive fiction work _Glass_ (2006) by Emily Short, with the code minimally updated and repackaged to work in the contemporary Inform editor for play, testing, and build/release.

### The problem

_Glass_ is currently available in two other forms:

-  a 2006 release hosted on the [IFDB Glass page](https://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=29l04xfgii5roq63) (061008). This includes a zblorb file for download or play online, but no source or other assets.
-  a 2010 release (101025) which was originally hosted on [the Inform homepage](http://inform7.com/), but that is now only available through the archive.org [wayback page](https://web.archive.org/web/20181010163302/http://inform7.com/learn/eg/glass/index.html). It includes a zblorb file, source, cover images, walkthroughs, and "making of" documentation.

Due to changes in Inform syntax (and the fact that old compilers cannot be run in current editors) _Glass_ cannot run or build a release using the current Inform editor. This is a shame, as it was one of the original games to showcase early releases of the language.

### The solution

This repo creates a 2020 release with the minimum syntax changes necessary to make _Glass_ compile and run on current Inform. It also repackages the work as an Inform 7 project, with assets in `.inform` and `.materials` folders, along with a full release.

### Credits

_Glass_ and all its code, images, and other assets are all by Emily Short.

This project by Jeremy Douglass, inspired by the code research of Ryan Leach.
It was first developed to give UCSB English 146GB students access to fully inspectable and explorable source code for the work while they played it.
